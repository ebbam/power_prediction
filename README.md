# Power and Prediction Markets
Complexity Global School - Group Project

This repository contains two project folders:
## code
main_pred_market.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the functionality of the prediction market model
simulations/: subfolder that includes code and results for the simulation experiments varying agent attributes and introducing a whale agent on the betting market. 
simulations/better.py: better class and market functions required to run the model

## DashVisualisation
Contains all relevant files (including market_functions.py - copy of better.py) for running a Dash app that allows users to test the performance of the agent-based prediction market model when varying the distribution of agent attribute values in the betting population. 

run "market_visualisation.py" to launch the Dash app on a local host.
